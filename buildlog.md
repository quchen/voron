Package arrived. Got Pif parts in blue and yellow.

PICTURE: overview over the box

Around 1m² of desk space cleaned, my trusty Prusa 2.5 went onto the gas oven
(turned off). Build area cleaned, let’s go!

Time: 15min

Downloaded the build manual for Voron (and Stealthburner for later). Initialize
this Git repo. 5min

## Frame assembly

Extrusions sorted and labeled. 10min

Adding screws to A extrusions. I remember my friend telling me about the _frame
spring fasteners_ that they forgot initially. Time to open the
[MagicPhoenix manual](http://mpx.wiki/) as well! Yup, use (non-standard) frame
spring fasteners.

30 minutes later, cube almost finished, forgot thread locker. Fuck. Anyway, time
to get the DIN angle for fine tuning, and the thread locker. Undo all the screws
again. Need to go boudlering though, and threadlocker would set a time limit on
assembly and squaring. Stopping frame assembly for now.

Total time taken during frame assembly so far: 45min.

15 minutes of unpacking linear rails, finding a suitable glass, and putting the
sliders into IPA. Now I will go bouldering for real, promise.
