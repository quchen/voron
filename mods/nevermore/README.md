# Official readme

Four parts; Plenum+Lid, and Cartridge+Lid.

Choose between regular and XL cartridge. XL is just 10mm longer, which can make
a big difference in air flow.

Choose XL for max carbon content and filter duration, and if you don't mind the
fan (200Pa+) has to run faster/noisier. You probably have to use pellets instead
of granular carbon too.

Choose regular if you have granular carbon and/or a weaker fan, and/or wish to
have a more silent experience. Regular also allows for somewhat higher airflow,
which could make a small difference compared to XL in chamber heat up times.
